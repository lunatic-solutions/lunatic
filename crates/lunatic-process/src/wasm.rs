        // Wasm code will be correctly reported to the parent.
        //
        // We assume here that the code inside of `process::new()` will not fail during signal
        // handling.
        //
        // **Parent link guarantees**:
        // A `tokio::task::yield_now()` call is executed to allow the parent to link the child
        // before continuing any further execution. This should force the parent to process all
        // signals right away.

        // The parent could have received a `kill` signal in its mailbox before this function was
        // called and this signal is going to be processed before the link is established (FIFO).
        // Only after the yield function we can guarantee that the child is going to be notified
        // if the parent fails. This is ok, as the actual spawning of the child happens after the
        // call, so the child wouldn't even exist if the parent failed before.
        //
        // TODO: The guarantees provided here don't hold anymore in a distributed environment and
        //       will require some rethinking. This function will be executed on a completely
        //       different computer and needs to be synced in a more robust way with the parent
