Lunatic is a universal runtime for **fast**, **robust** and **scalable** server-side applications.
It's inspired by Erlang and can be used from any language that compiles to [WebAssembly][1].
You can read more about the motivation behind Lunatic [here][2].

We currently provide libraries to take full advantage of Lunatic's features for:

- [Rust][3]
- [AssemblyScript][11]
